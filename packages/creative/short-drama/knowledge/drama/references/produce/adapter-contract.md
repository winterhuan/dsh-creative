```

- `modality`: `image`, `video`, `tts`, or `music`. `tts` is one bounded spoken
  utterance; `music` is a separately accepted timeline-level cue or song and
  must not be smuggled into every shot's video job.
- `source`: optional current project text/spec that owns the prompt.
- `source_entry`: for a creator-first job, the exact uppercase H2 ID inside a
  canonical `剧集|episodes/<EP>/` creator document, matched to that document:
  `图片提示词.md` takes `IMG-*` (image), `视频提示词.md` takes `MOTION-*` (video),
  and `分镜.md` takes `SHOT-*` (image, whose prompt is the shot's
  `### 冻结关键帧提示词` body rather than `### 可复制提示词`). A new image/video job pointing to either canonical filename must
  provide the matching selector; an arbitrary Markdown file cannot impersonate a
  creator source. `prepare` selects that section and requires `prompt` to exactly
  equal its copyable prompt after Markdown quote markers are removed.
- `reference_bindings`: zero to sixteen ordered semantic bindings. Every entry has
  exactly `slot_id`, contiguous `order`, project-relative `path`, creator `label`,
  non-empty `role`, and non-empty `may_control` / `must_not_control` lists. When
  `source_entry` is present, these fields must exactly match that entry's
  `参考` (IMG) or `输入参考图` (SHOT/MOTION) declaration (except `role`, which is
  production metadata). Allowed and prohibited scopes may not overlap.
  The creator declaration also carries a `用途` — what this picture decides in
  this shot, from the closed set in the storyboard skill. `role` is its
  production-side translation and is chosen per provider, so the two are not
  compared; a binding whose `role` contradicts the declared `用途` is a defect
  the creator document, not this schema, is the authority on. This schema keeps
  `role` free-form because an external adapter names its own inputs, but the
  bundled video adapters read it as the provider's own role and accept only
  their published vocabulary: `first_frame`, `last_frame`, `reference_image`,
  `reference_video`, `reference_audio` for MiniMax, and the three `reference_*`
  values for Seedance. A video job carrying references without bindings fails
  closed there rather than having a role guessed for it.
- `references`: zero to sixteen current project files actually sent to production.
  It may be omitted when `reference_bindings` is present, in which case the paths
  are derived in binding order. If both are present, they must match exactly.
- `outputs`: one to sixteen unique paths rooted at top-level `production/` or
  `剧集|episodes/<EP>/制作成果|production/`; extensions must match the modality.
  A nested directory merely named `production` does not grant write access to
  protected input or delivery trees.
- `parameters`: provider-neutral public settings only. Image/video jobs carry the resolved
  `prompt_language` so a bundled compiler writes its appended reference contract in the same
  language as the copyable prompt; this execution-only setting is not forwarded as a provider
  request field. Secret-like keys are rejected.
- `overwrite`: must be explicitly true to replace an existing result.

`prepare` records internal digests of source/reference bytes and returns the exact confirmation phrase. Callers never
calculate those digests. A changed input requires prepare and confirmation again.
Jobs already prepared and stored before this contract remain readable under their
original fingerprint. New non-creator structured jobs remain valid without
`source_entry` and `reference_bindings`; they still receive the existing
path/digest/confirmation checks. A `music` job may continue to use the timeline
music section of canonical `视频提示词.md` without pretending that section is a
`MOTION-*` entry; other new image/video jobs using canonical creator paths must use
their matching selector.

## Adapter config

Keep this file outside the project:

```json
{
  "adapters": {
    "studio-image": {
      "command": ["python3", "/opt/studio/image_adapter.py"],
      "timeout_seconds": 600
    }
  }
}
```

`command` is an argv array, never a shell string. Timeout is 1–3600 seconds. Do not put credentials in this file;
let the adapter read its environment or operating-system credential store.

## Adapter stdin

The adapter receives one UTF-8 JSON document as raw stdin bytes. Read the
binary stream (for example `json.load(sys.stdin.buffer)`) rather than relying
on the machine locale. The document contains the confirmed job plus:

- `run_id`: unique attempt ID;
- `project_root`: local absolute path to a private, run-scoped snapshot containing
  the exact confirmed `source` and `references`. It is not the live creator
  project and is deleted after the attempt.
- `output_root`: empty private, run-scoped staging directory owned by the
  production tool. Every adapter output source must be a direct regular-file
  child of this directory. The whole directory is deleted after success or
  failure.

It may translate provider-neutral parameters into its chosen SDK/API. Optional
provider adapters under `scripts/` document and implement known translations;
the project job remains provider-neutral, and adapter selection, model access,
polling and credentials stay in the external runtime configuration.

The confirmed document includes `source_entry` and `reference_bindings`. Bundled
image/video compilers append ordered reference purposes in `parameters.prompt_language`, using
the model's reference tokens, such as Seedance `@图片1` or H3 `<Picture 1>`.
Creator labels and control scopes remain in the job and are never appended to the provider prompt.
External adapters must apply the reference purposes or reject the job.

The Agnes video runtime resolves an unset or blank model to the free `agnes-video-2.5-flash`; an explicit `agnes-video-2.5` selects the model billed per second. Its runner compiles the model, parameters and snapshotted references before consuming confirmation. Local validation failures report the rejected requirement without launching the adapter, consuming the receipt or recording a production attempt. The adapter compiles the same snapshot again before submission; no compiled provider payload is added to the stored job.

## Adapter stdout

On success, write one bounded UTF-8 JSON object to stdout. Portable adapters
should ASCII-escape JSON strings so Windows locale settings cannot corrupt
project paths:

```json
{
  "outputs": [
    {
      "target": "剧集/EP001/制作成果/images/SHOT001.png",
      "source": "/temporary/adapter/result.png"
    }
  ],
  "provider_job_id": "optional-public-id"
}
```

Targets must appear in exactly the confirmed order. Sources must be direct
regular-file children of `output_root`, not symlinks. The tool opens each source
without following links, copies the pinned bytes into the project, records
size/media type/checksum, and removes staging. It never stores adapter
stdout/stderr or environment values.

On a provider failure, an adapter may write only this whitelisted evidence to stdout:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "provider": "studio-image",
    "category": "rate_limit",
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "http_status": 429,
    "request_id": "request_safe_123",
    "retryable": true,
    "submission_rejected": true
  }
}
```

Never include provider messages, response bodies, prompts, paths or credentials.
The production run record keeps only validated fields; malformed failure output
is replaced with a generic adapter exit code.

`submission_rejected` is optional and may be true only when the provider explicitly rejects the initial submission before accepting work. The bundled adapters emit it only for initial-request HTTP 401, 403 or 429 responses. Polling, downloads, redirected requests and uncertain failures must omit it or use false. `retryable` alone never authorizes resubmission.

A nonzero exit, timeout, malformed response or mismatched output marks the run failed. Because the adapter may have
submitted paid work before failing locally, confirmation is consumed as soon as execution starts; retry only after a
new creator confirmation. Within one confirmed DSH run, an explicit initial-submission authentication, permission or rate-limit rejection may switch to another configured key; accepted or uncertain submissions are not retried. A job with an unresolved `running` attempt cannot be prepared, confirmed, or run again;
wait for its terminal record or investigate the interrupted attempt first.

## Operational reconciliation

`production_tool.py audit <project>` reads only local production metadata and the
current output bytes. It reports terminal failures, retryable failures, recovered
jobs, unresolved running attempts, repeated content fingerprints, and missing or
changed outputs. Terminal state, recovery, and repeated output claims are ordered
by validated completion time rather than start time. For paths written more than
once, the latest completed successful claim is authoritative for this operational
check. Only attempts bound to the current stored job fingerprint can claim its
current outputs; older fingerprints remain visible as `superseded` attempt history.
A successful record must declare exactly the current job's output set and media
types before any output claim is trusted. Jobs, confirmations, run records, and the
production lock use pinned no-follow directories where directory FDs are available,
and reparse/identity checks on the portable fallback. A linked parent chain fails
closed instead of redirecting state outside the project.

The audit deliberately returns `quality_verdict: not_assessed`. A provider success,
retry recovery, file presence, size, or checksum proves execution/custody only; it
does not prove identity, performance, continuity, lip-sync, mix, edit, or audience
quality. Those claims require an authorized observation and a separate review.
